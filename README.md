# Memory Game Project

This game was built as a Udacity Course project. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to play

The goal of the game is to match all cards in less time with less moves. 

The deck is made up of 8 pairs of cards, each with different font on one side. Flip a card over to reveal its underlying font, then turn over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same font. If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state. The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
